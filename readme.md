You are given a dual-pane shopping interface. The interface consists of two panes:
- **Left Pane** (Item List): Displays a list of shopping items.
- **Right Pane** (Cart): Shows the items added to the userâ€™s cart.

3 minor bugs require your attention.

#### Bugs
1. Adding an item in the cart via Item List should update the Cart accordingly.
2. Removing an item from the Cart should work.
3. If an item is already selected, clicking on the item in the Item List should remove it from the Cart.

### Submission Instructions

1. Clicking "Run code" will compile and run your code against sample tests, but it will not generate scores. Click on "Execution Log" to better understand the test execution.
2. Clicking "Submit code" will run your code against multiple test cases, assessing different scenarios holistically. The score will be assigned accordingly.

To access the instructions, click on the "Question" button which can be found in the bottom left corner of the screen.
